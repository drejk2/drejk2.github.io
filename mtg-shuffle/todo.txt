format text windows to be ~80 char. long (in em; http://pxtoem.com)
when page small enough, make cardlist clip to buttons and bottom (when body.a) or page-left + page-div fill whole page (when body.b)
change colors (base, generate button, page-div, ...)
complete transition from shuffler v1
buttons have text inside when large enough, otherwise signs/images
add information on accepted input formats (space between number and cardname)
too much space on the right when #content.c
scrollbars interfere with page when page too small
make #content > .left horizontally resizable when #content.b
if text in #cardlist doesn't need that much horizontal space, make it slimmer
mess around with textarea:focus styling (now there's blue border)
make fallbacks for uncommonly supported features, switched off js, warnings for users with obsolete browsers
put textarea into form and enable submit
